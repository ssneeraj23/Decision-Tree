# Decision-Tree

* Developed a Decision Tree model from scratch in Python without using any ML libraries. The model is used to perform classification tasks.
* Implemented ID3 algorithm and trained the classifier using Information Gain measure.
* Performed reduced error pruning on the best-performing tree obtained and analyzed the variation in test accuracy with different tree
depths and printed the final decision tree in the terminal using Pprint module in Python.
